/**
 * NOTE: agent-specific (passthrough mode).
 *
 * Compute maxTurns based on which SDK features are active.
 *
 * The default is 1, and that is the whole point. In passthrough the CLIENT
 * executes tools, so a turn that emits tool_use is already complete as far as
 * the client is concerned. Anything the SDK generates after it — the "digest"
 * turn where the model reacts to the PreToolUse denial — is discarded by the
 * proxy and still billed by Anthropic. Capping at 1 makes the SDK stop at the
 * tool-use boundary instead of generating that turn.
 *
 * A capped stop surfaces as `error_max_turns`, which is safe here precisely
 * because the SDK can only report it from a `result` message it has already
 * enqueued, and it awaits its transcript flush on `result`. So the session is
 * durably committed at the tool boundary; server.ts stores that checkpoint and
 * the next request resumes from it with the client's real tool_result. A turn
 * that ends without wanting to continue (plain text, no tools) never trips the
 * cap at all — it returns a normal success result.
 *
 * Measured against the live SDK (sonnet, one tool call), cap vs. the old base
 * of 3: 66 vs 159 output tokens and 0 vs ~127k cache-read tokens, because the
 * digest turn drags the CLI's full context along with it.
 *
 * The bumps below are the cases that genuinely need the SDK to keep going, and
 * each one turns the cap off rather than adding to it:
 *   - Deferred tools (4): a ToolSearch discovery is a real model round-trip
 *     that consumes a turn before the model can emit the real tool_use. Capping
 *     here would stop the query on the discovery turn and never reach the tool
 *     call (#547).
 *   - Advisor (+3): server-side advisor executes call + result + final answer.
 *   - Structured output: the SDK runs its internal StructuredOutput tool and
 *     needs turns to submit the result; capping strands it (HTTP 500).
 *   - Early-stop kill switch off: MERIDIAN_PASSTHROUGH_EARLY_STOP=0 restores
 *     the pre-cap wire behavior wholesale, so the budget must come back too.
 *
 * Base for those uncapped cases stays 3: turn 1 generates content (extended
 * thinking + tool_use blocks captured by PreToolUse hook); turn 2 receives the
 * deny and may emit a follow-up; turn 3 wraps the stream cleanly. Was 2
 * historically — bumped after telemetry showed opus[1m] requests with thinking
 * + tool_use exhausting the 2-turn budget mid-handoff and returning 500s on
 * fresh (non-resume) requests. Resume adds nothing: rehydration completes
 * inline within turn 1.
